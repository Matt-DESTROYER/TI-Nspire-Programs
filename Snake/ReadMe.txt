How to use:
Menu:
In the menu use the arrow and enter keys to select a tool. Press enter at
any time to return to the menu.

Surd Simplifier:
Using the number keys on your calculator, input a number and the Maths
Tool software will automatically output the steps required to simplify
the square root of that number. To clear the input digits, press the
delete button on your calculator.

How to get Maths Tool on your calculator:
If you have any software allowing you to send TNS files (any files ending
in '.tns') to your calculator, simply send the Maths Tool.tns file to your
calculator using that software. Otherwise, the easiest software that will
allow you to send TNS files to your calculator is the TI-Nspire Computer
Link Software which can be downloaded from:
